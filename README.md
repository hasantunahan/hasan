# SIU

Warning: This is a one-time code drop to accompany the ReactJS conference talk, and is not accessible outside the official conference attendees - please don't share this code.

This is also a very early alpha release. There are certainly bugs and missing features. Some things may even be well-documented in JS, but missing from the native implementation. We are committed to improving and expanding the capabilities of this project as fast as we can, and look forward to working with the community.

React Native
Our first React Native implementation is ReactKit, targeting iOS. We are also working on an Android implementation which we will release later. ReactKit apps are built using the React JS framework, and render directly to native UIKit elements using a fully asynchronous architecture. There is no browser and no HTML. We have picked what we think is the best set of features from these and other technologies to build what we hope to become the best product development framework available, with an emphasis on iteration speed, developer delight, continuity of technology, and absolutely beautiful and fast products with no compromises in quality or capability.

Requirements
OS X - This repo only contains the iOS implementation right now, and Xcode only runs on Mac.
New to Xcode? Download it from the Mac App Store.
Homebrew is the recommended way to install node, watchman, and flow.
New to node or npm? brew install node
We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug. brew install watchman
If you want to use flow, brew install flow
